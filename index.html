<h1>The Bouncer Bot</h1>
<h2>Made this bot so I don't need to ask people for their phone number or email address (for example people in my group)</h2>
<h2>It's a Knowledge-based authentication bot that asks you questions about my life</h2>
<h2>This will deter Scammers, predators, and other bad people from accessing my private areas on the internet, if it's secure</h2>
<h2>I strongly don't recommend children (under 18) from using this bot</h2>
